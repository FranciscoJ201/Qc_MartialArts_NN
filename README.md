- **Distance plotting** between two tracked IDs (per frame)
- **Frame range selector GUI** (time ‚Üí frames ‚Üí copy to folder)

> **Tip:** Keep your AlphaPose JSON and source video together. Readers will ask you to pick them and create outputs in `AlphaPose_Code` / `Video_Outputs`.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FranciscoJ201/Qc_MartialArts_NN.git
cd Qc_MartialArts_NN
```

### 2) Environment

Use Python 3.10‚Äì3.12. (3.13 also works for most scripts; if you‚Äôre using CUDA/PyTorch, prefer 3.10‚Äì3.12 for smoother wheels.)

**Conda (recommended):**

```bash
conda create -n qcmartial python=3.11 -y
conda activate qcmartial
```

**Pip requirements:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present
# or install the core pieces manually
pip install opencv-python numpy tqdm pillow
```

> The GUIs use `tkinter` (bundled with most Python installs). On Linux you may need `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.

### 3) AlphaPose outputs

Generate AlphaPose JSON for your video(s). Place the JSON alongside the matching video file. (This repo **consumes** AlphaPose output; it doesn‚Äôt run AlphaPose itself.)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Common Workflows

### A) Two‚Äëperson reader (with optional distance)

```bash
python main.py
```

- Choose **AlphaPose JSON** and **Video** when prompted.
- Toggle **‚ÄúPlot distance‚Äù** if supported by your `reader.py` build.
- Produces frames under `AlphaPose_Code/` and a compiled video under `Video_Outputs/`.

**Direct call (advanced):**

```python
from reader import run_pose_plotter
run_pose_plotter(plot_distance=True)  # or False
```

### B) Single‚Äësubject reader

Focus on one ID; other people are hidden.

```python
from singleReader import run_single_pose_plotter
run_single_pose_plotter()
```

### C) Frame range selector GUI

Turn times (seconds) into exact frame indices and copy only that slice.

```python
from frameGUIandSelect import frame_selector
frame_selector(json_path, video_path)
```

Result goes to `AlphaPose_Code/selected_frames/`.

### D) Repair inconsistent IDs

Stabilize IDs across frames before plotting.

```bash
python repair2.py
```

You‚Äôll be prompted for the JSON to repair; output (e.g., `repaired.json`) is saved next to it. Then feed `repaired.json` to the readers.

**What it does** (high level):

- Keeps a short **pose history** to match people across frames
- Enforces a **maximum pixel jump** to reduce ID swaps
- **Avoids creating new IDs** mid‚Äësequence unless warranted
- Can **drop late-appearing detections** that don‚Äôt belong to the initial set

---

## üì¶ Outputs

- **Images** with keypoints/lines, color‚Äëcoded per ID
- **Distance labels** (if enabled)
- **Videos** compiled from per‚Äëframe images
- **Selected frames** copied by the frame selector

Suggested structure:

```
AlphaPose_Code/
  ‚îú‚îÄ images/               # per-frame keypoint renders
  ‚îú‚îÄ selected_frames/      # copied by frame selector GUI
  ‚îî‚îÄ logs/                 # run logs (optional)
Video_Outputs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ <your_output>.mp4
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes

- **Track IDs:** Readers expect AlphaPose ‚Äú`idx`/track\_id\`‚Äù fields. For 3D readers or alternative formats, adapt the JSON parser.
- **Distance metric:** Pixel distance between chosen ID centers; convert to meters by calibrating with a known scale.
- **Performance:** If rendering is slow, reduce image size or skip every N frames for previews.

---

## üß™ Example Snippets

**Plot two IDs and write a video:**

```python
from reader import run_pose_plotter
run_pose_plotter(plot_distance=True)
```

**Export a 4‚Äì7s slice as frames:**

```python
from frameGUIandSelect import frame_selector
frame_selector("path/to/repaired.json", "path/to/video.mp4")
# GUI: start=4, end=7 ‚Üí copies frames to selected_frames/
```

---

## ü©π Troubleshooting

- **TorchVision warnings**: ‚Äú`pretrained` is deprecated; use `weights`.‚Äù ‚Üí Harmless; future‚Äëproof by switching to the `weights=` API if you customize models.
- **Tkinter messagebox errors**: If you see `messagebox.showinfo` raising errors, ensure the root Tk app is initialized before dialogs, or remove modal dialogs when running headless.
- **CUDA DLL not found (Windows)**: If you later add GPU inference (e.g., for AlphaPose), ensure matching **CUDA/cuDNN** versions are installed and on `PATH`.
- **FPS/time mismatch**: Make sure the FPS read from the video matches the one used by your frame selector.

---

## üß≠ Roadmap

- Pixel‚Üímeter conversion (camera calibration helpers)
- Batch processing for many JSON/video pairs
- Optional optical-flow continuity & ReID embeddings for better track reassignment
- 3D pose support notes / converters
