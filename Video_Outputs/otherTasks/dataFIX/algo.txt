save each initial id with its inital keypoints in a data structure for previous ids for example a dict with its id then value pair of keypoints

for each frame in the json:
    for each id in frame:
        if id = previous_id
            check if keypoints logically make sense, for example couldnt have teleported 1000 pixels across the screen
            else skip that person until logical keypoints for them reappear within rougly 200 pixels

ALGO #2
- should include pose history
- pixel detection (if another reappears on the other side of the screen it should not be mapped to the same index, people cant travel that far that quick)
